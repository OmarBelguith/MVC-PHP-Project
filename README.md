Description of the application
Shareboard is a simple application to help users share cool and new stuff. Users can see what other people have shared and can also add their own shares as well, of course, after they register. The application uses SESSIONS to store temporary information about the users across all pages and uses Bootstrap for HTML and CSS styling.

Note: This application is far from finished and it's functionality is very limited, but let's hope Someone can benefit from the logic of MVC
end the code snippets that are written.
